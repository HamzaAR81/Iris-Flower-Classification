# Iris Flower Classification

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook for a machine learning model to classify Iris flowers into different species based on their features. The model utilizes the well-known Iris dataset, including measurements of sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width for three Iris species: setosa, versicolor, and virginica.

## Overview

- **Objective:** Develop a classification model to predict the species of Iris flowers based on their features.
- **Dataset:** The Iris dataset is a well-known dataset available in the Scikit-learn library.
